PROFESSIONAL HIGHLIGHTS


I'm a frontend-focused software engineer with 2 years of experience building responsive, accessible web apps in React and Rails. I didn’t fall in love with coding because of the tools; I fell in love with what those tools could create. I care about building software that helps people move faster, understand more, or express themselves more freely.
